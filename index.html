            The domestic dog (Canis familiaris or Canis lupus familiaris) is a
            domesticated descendant of the wolf.The dog derived from an ancient,
            extinct wolf, and the modern grey wolf is the dog's nearest living
            relative. The dog was the first species to be domesticated, by
            hunter–gatherers over 15,000 years ago, before the development of
            agriculture.
